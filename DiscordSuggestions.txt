# This page is to be used for suggestions for our community, website, and discord server.  
# If you have a suggestion for us, please add it here as a comment, on it's own line.  
# Then, create a pull request.  I'll look it over, then if all good, will merge your request.  

# This should give us better tracking of our suggestions, but please still feel free to use
# '#suggestions' in the Discord Server.  

# Please note, for our newer members, this could be used as your first PR *PULL REQUEST*
